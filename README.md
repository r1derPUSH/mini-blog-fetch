## ﻿📝 Mini Project: Mini Blog

## 🚀 Project Overview
This small project demonstrates how to work with fetch, async/await, and public APIs in JavaScript to GET and POST blog posts.
Posts are either shown in the console or displayed on the page dynamically.

## 🔧 Features
GET — Fetch and display a list of posts from a public API

POST — Send a new post using the POST method via fetch

Render — Show the fetched posts in the DOM using JavaScript

## 🌐 API Used
We use the free fake REST API JSONPlaceholder:

GET Posts:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

POST Post:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

## 📦 How It Works
getPosts()

An async function that fetches a list of posts

Displays posts starting from the 85th post onward

Each post is displayed one by one with a delay (500ms)

addPost(post)

An async function that sends a new post object to the API

Includes fields: title, body, userId, id

## 💡 Learning Goal
Learn how to use fetch() with async/await

Understand the basics of working with REST APIs

Practice adding dynamic elements to the DOM

Work with asynchronous code and delays
